  "description" : "This is a revival of the old Kazdra (dragon) race mod.\n\nIf your having issues with the steam version, try the manual way:\n0.1.3: (Coming soon)\nYou can submit bug reports here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/949156982/1471969431580372213/\n\nThis mods adds a race of dragons to play as, known as the Kazdra. It's a little ramshackle and pasted together, but it works with 1.3 perfectly now.\n\nBackstory: The Kazdra come of a planet weak with metals, so they used crystals instead. Metals were only to be used very rarely. As their planet's small supply of metal ran out, they used what was left and took to the stars, searching for a new place to call home.\n\nComing soon:\n> [strike]Codex entries for backstory and lore[/strike] Basic version of this is in place! \n> Fancy new armors and weapons (once i learn how to sprite correctly lol)!\n> Maybe some mech parts!\n> Some other surprises ;)\n\nFeedback is more than welcome! Let me know what you think!\n\n0.1.3 \"Took Long Enough!\" update:\n> Fixed minor mis-spellings in the converse file (punctation, capitalization)\n> Adjusted starting pistol energy cost (8.0 >> 12.0)\n> Made a level 2 pistol (Lower energy usage, higher damage, higher knockback)\nThanks to \"zekrom_vale\" for the following help:\n   > Added actual recipes for most items (Still working on a few!)\n   > Added price to agrizon (null >> 55)\n   > Updated spawner_kazdra object\n   > Found some more mis-spellings missed in converse file\n   > NPC's spawn with correct clothes\nThanks to \"Max\" for the following help:\n   > Fixed the platforms\n   > Fixed the teanents for kazdras (they spawn properly now, place kazdra furniture down to spawn)\n\n0.1.3.1 Update:\n> Removed faulty spawner recipies causing a insta-crash",
